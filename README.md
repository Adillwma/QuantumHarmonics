# Introduction

In this problem we will find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the 1D Schr√∂dinger equation using numerical methods from which we can calculate the energy and position (spatial distribution probability density) of a quantum mechanical system, i.e. an electron in an atom. 

## Part 1 - The Quantum Harmonic Oscillator 

The quantum harmonic oscillator is a good example to start with, since it has exact analytic solutions. 



### Analytical 

#### Eigenvalues (Energy Levels)
Analytically the energy levels of the quantum harmonic oscillator are given by :

$$
E_n = \hbar \omega (n + \frac{1}{2})  \tag{1}
$$

where $n$ is a non-negative integer representing the primary quantum number of the energy level, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the oscillator. This equation represents the quantization of energy levels in the quantum harmonic oscillator. Each energy level is equally spaced, with a separation of $\hbar \omega$ between adjacent levels so the energy eigenvalues are simply $n + \frac{1}{2}$. Given we are expressing energy in terms of $\frac{1}{2} \hbar \omega$, the energy levels simplify to odd integers given by $2n + 1$.

#### Eigenvectors (Wavefunctions)
The eigenvectors are given by :

$$
\psi_n(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n n!}} \left(\frac{m \omega}{\pi \hbar}\right)^{1/4} e^{-\frac{m \omega x^2}{2 \hbar}} H_n\left(\sqrt{\frac{m \omega}{\hbar}} x\right)  \tag{2}
$$

where $H_n$ are the Hermite polynomials. 

Plotting the first 4 analytically derived wavefunctions we get :

We can use the above to test our numerical method.  We will choose a value for $\omega$ and a range of $x$ values, and use the above to construct the Hamiltonian matrix $H$.  We can then use a linear algebra solver to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $H$, and compare the results to the analytical solutions.


???????????????We will use the scipy.linalg.eigh_tridiagonal function to solve the eigenvalue problem, which is a wrapper for the LAPACK functions for solving the eigenvalue problem for a symmetric tridiagonal matrix. We will use the scipy.special.hermite function to calculate the Hermite polynomials.
???????????

### Simulation 

We will attempt to calulate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors by solving the time independant schrodinger equation using numerical methods and compare the results to the exact analytical solutions shown above. 

The time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation in 1D can be written :

$$
H \psi = E \psi \tag{FIX!!} 
$$

Where the Hamiltonian $H$ is given by 

$$
H = \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + V \tag{3}
$$

In order to find numerical solutions, we can divide the spatial dimension into $N$ discrete points, $x_i$, and evaluate $\psi$ at each one.  Given this, equation 3 becomes a matrix equation, with $\psi$ an $N$-dimensional vector, and $H$ an $(N \times N)$ matrix.  We can then find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the equation using numerical methods.

In order to define the matrix $H$, we can use a discrete approximation of the 2nd derivative :
$$
\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \psi(x_i) \rightarrow \frac{\psi_{i-1} - 2\psi_i + \psi_{i+1}}{(\Delta x)^2}  \tag{4}
$$

where $(\Delta x)$ is the distance between discrete points $x_i$. We will choose dimensionless units for each problem, where $x$ is measured in terms of a length $a$, and $E$ is therefore measured in units of $\frac{\hbar^2}{2m a^2}$.  We can therefore write the kinetic energy term of the Hamiltonian as a "tri-diagonal" matrix $D$, which has the leading diagonal :

$$
D_{i,i} = \frac{2}{(\Delta x)^2}  \tag{5}
$$

and the diagonals above and below this are :

$$
D_{i,i+1} = D_{i,i-1} = \frac{-1}{(\Delta x)^2}   \tag{6}
$$

The potential term $V \psi$ can be represented by a matrix where the leading diagonal is the potential evaluated at the $i$-th point in space, $V_{i,i} = V(x_i)$, and all other entries are zero.

For the quantum harmonic oscillator, the potential is :

$$
V(x) = \frac{1}{2}m \omega^2 x^2   \tag{7}
$$

If we choose to measure $x$ in units of $\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{m \omega}}$, then $E$ will be measured in units of $\frac{1}{2}\hbar \omega$, and the potential can be written :

$$
V_i(x_i) = i^2 (\Delta x)^2 = x_i^2   \tag{8}
$$

Leaving us with a simple function which takes as argument a discrete set of space points, $x_i$, and returns the potential at each point, $V_i$ which is simple the square of the displacement $x_i$.

</div>


We construct the tri-diagonal kinetic energy term matrix $D$ as outlined above in equations 3 and 4, and then add the potential term to find the Hamiltonian matrix $H$.

Then using a linear algebra solver, we can solve for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $H$ to find the energy levels and wavefunctions of the quantum harmonic oscillator respectivly.

## NOTE:
It is important to use a large number of $x$ points, at least 1000, covering sufficient range that the wavefunction falls to zero at the extremities in order to ensure the numerical solutions stability as demonstrated in [Appendix Section 2.1](#Appendix_stability).


#### Eigenvalues (Energy Levels)

We compare the computed eigenvalues with the expected eigenvalues.

Looking back on our table of analytical values for the energy levels, and filling in our simulated values we can see we get a good match at low n but the error increases as n increases

To get a better idea of the error we can plot the error as a function of n, the results show good agreement between simulation and anylitical results for low n up to around 10, after which the error increases rapidly.

#### Eigenvectors (Wavefunctions)

Next you should plot the wavefunctions, ie. the eigenvectors.  Rather than plot the wavefunction directly, you should plot the probability density, which is given by $\psi^2$, and indicates the probability to find the particle at position $x$.

*The dotted u shape line shows the potential that we caluclated, combining the potential and the wavefunctions on this one plot allows us to see the classical limits, where the potential crosses each wavefunction. Classically the wavefucntion is not allowed to have a value other than 0 past these limits (turning points) but we can see here that it does, this is one of the dissagremments between classical and quantum theory.*

# Part 2 - The Hydrogen Atom

### Simulation

Having verified our method, we can use it to find the eigenvalues of a more complex system - the Hydrogen atom.  In a spherically symmetric system, the wavefunction can be written :

$$
\frac{1}{r}\Psi(r)Y_{lm}(\theta, \phi)e^{i m\phi} \tag{9}
$$

where $Y_{lm}(\theta, \phi)$ are the spherical harmonic functions and l, m are the angular momentum quantum numbers. The radial function $\Psi(r)$ satisfies the time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation, provided a suitable term is added to the potential.

Now that we are using a spherical coordinate system, we discritise a range of radius values, $r$, instead of $x$. If we use the Bohr radius $a_0$ as the unit $r$, where :

$$
a_0 = \frac{4 \pi \epsilon \hbar^2}{m_e e^2}  \tag{10}
$$

then the energy will be measured in units of :
$$
\frac{m_e e^4}{2 (4 \pi \epsilon_0)^2 \hbar^2}  \tag{11}
$$

and the potential for the hydrogen atom can be written :

$$
V(r_i) = \frac{-2}{r_i} + \frac{l(l+1)}{r_i^2} \tag{12}
$$

<div align="center">

We can now use the same method as outlined in section 1 to create the kinetic energy term matrix $D$ and add it to the potential $V$, to find the Hamiltonian matrix $H$. We agin use our linear algebra solver to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $H$, and compare the results to the expected eigenvalues and wavefunctions, this time for the Hydrogen atom.

!!!! to generate the Hamiltonian matrix for the Hydrogren atom, and find at least the first 5 eigenvalues for at least l=0. Compare these eigenvalues with the expected eigenvalues.
!!!!



#### NOTE:
We must use a range of $r$ such that the wavefunction become negligible, and a large number of $r$ points, at least 1000, to ensure the numerical solutions stability as demonstrated in [Appendix Section 2.1](#Appendix_stability).

The energy scale describes the required energy to move the electron from its bound state to infinity, a simpler way to think of it is the sum total energy of the nucleas and the electron is this much lower (hence the negative) than if they were seperated by an infinite distance

In addition to the quantized negative energy states of the hydrogen atom, there is also a continuum of unbound positive energy states.

The pattern in the given fractions seems to involve decreasing magnitudes of the fractions with a negative sign. Let's analyze:

-1 = -1/1
-0.25 = -1/4
-0.111 = -1/9
-0.0625 = -1/16
-0.04 = -1/25

Each fraction appears to be the reciprocal of the square of an integer:

1^2 = 1
2^2 = 4
3^2 = 9
4^2 = 16
5^2 = 25

So, the pattern is:

-1/(n^2)

</div>

To convert our  dimensionless results given in terms of $\frac{m_e e^4}{2 (4 \pi \epsilon_0)^2 \hbar^2}$ we can solve for the energy levels in terms of eV, by inputting the required constants :

- $m_e$: mass of an electron $\approx 9.109 \times 10^{-31}$ kg
- $e$: elementary charge $\approx 1.602 \times 10^{-19}$ C
- $\epsilon_0$: vacuum permittivity $\approx 8.854 \times 10^{-12}$ F/m
- $\hbar$: reduced Planck constant $\approx 1.055 \times 10^{-34}$ J¬∑s

Which yeilds :
$$
\frac{(9.109 \times 10^{-31}) \times (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^4}{2 \times (4 \pi \times 8.854 \times 10^{-12})^2 \times (1.055 \times 10^{-34})^2} \approx 13.606 \, \text{eV} \tag{13}
$$

Which we know is the enrgy of the ground state of the hydrogen atom, and each energy level is a multiple of this value. We can then convert our dimensionless results to eV by multiplying by 13.606.

##### NOTES!¬¨!!


Report:

To find the values of the allowed energy eigenvalues of a quantum system we have to apply the hamiltonian opperator to the wavefunction $(\psi)$. To simplify the problem we have taken it in one dimension and in time independsnt form where the wavefuntion is just a function of $x$ $\psi(x)$


$$H \psi(x) = E \psi(x)$$


The Hamiltonian $H$ is given by 


$$H = \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + V $$


it contains two terms, the potential energy term V and the kinetic energy term D where 


$$D = \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2}{dx^2}$$


the potential term can be implemented easily as a simple function, however D requires the use of numerical methods as it contains a continuous derivative.


Given this, the hamiltonian is implemented as a matrix equation, with $\psi$ an $N$-dimensional vector, and $H$ an $(N \times N)$ matrix.
The matrix is symmetric, we can find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the matrix using readily availibly pyton routines from the scipy libraries. I chose to test two solvers, scipy.linalg.eig and scipy.linalg.eigh_tridiagonal to compare their results. At first the eig fucntion was returning some strange results but then i realised the returned values were not sorted, so after adding a quicksort function via np.sort() it returned the exact same results as the eigh_tridiagonal function.

As both function methods returned the exact same results it would be down to compute resources rather than accuracy to pick one, i did not implement a time loop to test the difference as my code is alredy substantial. Without having tested it i would pick using the eigh_tridiagonal function as it requires a much simpler hamiltonian function, less memory usage from not having to store the majority 0 valued matricies, and requires no np.sort to return the results.

Testing both methods on the QHO problem and then comparing the Eigenvalues to the analytical results showed that the solvers can provide acuurate results for the QHO up to around an E_n value of 10. I then did the same for comparing eigenvectors to the analytical results but only the first 4 terms. The results of the solvers come out exactly mathcing the analytical eigenvectors albeit with a scale mismatch that i assume is down to a unit conversion scaling.

Then made some interesting plots of the wavefunctions and probability distributions for a range of the QHO's energy eigenstates, including one which overlayed the potental with the wavefunctions to demonstrate the mismatch in classical and quantum theory in the ability of the wavefucntion to have a value outside of the classicly deifned turning points.

Moved on to the hydrogen atom where ran through the same as for the QHO. Compared the potential of the QHO to the Hydrogen atom which showed interesting differences in the two systems. Also compared the analytical hydrogen eigenvalues with the solvers which provide accurate results up till around E_n 20 this time.

The previous visuals were all based on the radial wavefunction which each have a unique energy value, but the total wavefucntion for the hydrogen atom consists of the radial wavefunction and the angular wavefunction which gives each energy level above n=1 more than one possible state, they are degenerate. Created visulisations for the hydrogen atoms l and m quantum numbers in 2 and 3D to show how the various numbers effect the probability distribution of the electron, showing the degenerate states that give rise to the s, p... orbital shells.







## Appendix

### Quantum Numbers

Quantum numbers are numbers that specify the state of a quantum system. If you know all of the quantum numbers for a system that is a complete description of state. A way to analogise this is to think of a chess board. To have a full definition of the state of the chess game i.e. all the information required to exactly recreate the game, you could write down the information of whatis present in each qaure of the board. However, this fixes the information to the spacial domain, wheras in reality properties are tied to objects not the space they inhabit. Additonally stroign information for every square (spatial position) requires more information storage as data is kept on empty squares.For an object focused definiton of state in the smallest amount of information possible, you would need to know the piece type, color (white/black) and the board position for each piece on the board. The amount of information required to define the state of the chess game is 3 values per piece present on the board, we could give these three bits of information quantum numbers a b and c for chess pieces. 

An important note here is that although i have used the position of the chess peices as one of thier quantum numbers in this analogy, this is only to get across the conncept of a full definition of state for a system. There is no quantum number tied to position, they are tied to the properties of the object, from which the positotion is emergent. Further, quantum mechanics does not allow for the exact position of a particle to be known at all, only the **probability** of finding it in a certain position, which we derive from the wavefunction.




The quantum harmonic oscillator, which describes a particle (often an electron) confined in a quadratic potential well, possesses only one quantum number, which represents the energy level of the oscillator. This is the single piece of information required to define the entire state of the oscillating system. The quantum number representing the energy of a quantum system is called the principle quantum number, and is denoted by the letter $n$. Its values are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...) meaning a quantum harmonic oscillator can have energy levels of n = 1, n = 2, n = 3 etc.

In the case of an electron in an atom the quantum numbers are more complex, as the electron is confined in a 3D potential well. The quantum numbers for an electron in an atom are the principal quantum number (n), the azimuthal quantum number (l), the magnetic quantum number (m), and the spin quantum number (s). The principal quantum number (n) is the same as for the quantum harmonic oscillator, and represents the energy level of the electron. The azimuthal quantum number (l) represents the angular momentum of the electron, and the magnetic quantum number (m) represents the projection of the angular momentum along a given axis. The spin quantum number (s) represents the intrinsic angular momentum of the electron, either spin up or spin down.
