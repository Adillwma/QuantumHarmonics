## Introduction
Our current understanding of the most fundamental aspects of our universe comes from Quantum Mechanics. Central to this framework is the Schr√∂dinger equation, a core equation in quantum mechanics that governs the behaviour of quantum systems. A form of this equation known as the 'time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation' or TISE provides insights into the quantized energy levels and spatial distributions of a quantum system. Analytical solutions are often infeasible for complex systems, necessitating numerical techniques. This project is designed to solve the TISE numerically to simulate various quantum systems and visualize the results.


## Part 1 - The Quantum Harmonic Oscillator 
The Quantum Harmonic-Oscillator (QHO) is a quantum mechanical analogue of the classical harmonic oscillator, representing a quantum system that oscillates about an equilibrium position, such as a vibrating diatomic molecule. The quantum harmonic oscillator is a good example to begin building our simulation, since it has exact analytic solutions we can use to validate our simulations results.


### Analytical Solution

#### Energy Levels
Analytically the energy levels of the quantum harmonic oscillator are given by :

$$
E_n = \hbar \omega (n + \frac{1}{2})  \tag{1}
$$

where $n$ is a non-negative integer representing the primary quantum number of the energy level, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the oscillator. 

This equation represents the **quantization** of energy levels in the quantum harmonic oscillator. Quantisation is an core idea of Quantum Mechanics (hence the name). In the case of the Quantum Harmonic Oscillator, each energy level is equally spaced, with a separation of $\hbar \omega$ between adjacent levels, so the eigenvalues are simply $n + \frac{1}{2}$. Given we are expressing energy in terms of $\frac{1}{2} \hbar \omega$, the energy levels simplify to odd integers given by $2n + 1$.

#### Wavefunctions
The analytical **eigenvectors** $\psi_n$ of the QHO are given by,

$$
\psi_n(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n n! \sqrt{\pi}}} e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}} H_n(x)
$$

This equation is made up of three terms, $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n n! \sqrt{\pi}}}$ is the normalization constant which ensures that the wavefunction is properly normalized, i.e. $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi_n(x)|^2 dx = 1$. Next is the Gaussian term $e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}$ representing the ground state probability distribution, which peaks at $x=0$ and decays rapidly as $x$ moves away from zero, and finally $H_n(x)$ is the Hermite polynomial of degree $n$, given by,

$$
H_n(x) = (-1)^n e^{x^2} \frac{d^n}{dx^n} e^{-x^2}
$$

Solving for the first three wavefunctions we get the following:

It is hard to get an idea of what these wavefunctions look like from the above table, but if we now plot the wavefunctions against the displacement in $x$ we get a much clearer view of thier shape and how that changes with the energy level.

### Simulation 
We will now attempt to calulate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the same QHO system, this time by solving the TISE using numerical methods. We can then compare the results to the exact analytical solutions shown above to validate our methodology.

The energy levels $E_n$, and the wavefunctions $\psi$ of the quantum harmonic oscillator can be calculated from the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Schr√∂dinger equation for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential. The time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation in 1D can be written,

$$
\hat{H} \psi = \hat{E} \psi \tag{FIX!!} 
$$

The Hamiltonian operator $\hat{H}$ is given by 

$$
\hat{H} = \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + V \tag{3}
$$

Where:
- $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.
- $m$ is the mass of the oscillator.
- $V$ is the potential energy.

For the quantum harmonic oscillator, the potential is :

$$
V(x) = \frac{1}{2}m \omega^2 x^2   \tag{7}
$$

where $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the oscillator.

</div>

In order to find numerical solutions, we can divide the spatial dimension into $N$ discrete points, $x_i$, and evaluate $\psi$ at each one.  Given this, equation 3 becomes a matrix equation, with $\psi$ an $N$-dimensional vector, and $H$ an $(N \times N)$ matrix.  We can then find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the equation using numerical methods.

In order to define the matrix $\hat{H}$, we can use a discrete approximation of the 2nd derivative,
$$
\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \psi(x_i) \rightarrow \frac{\psi_{i-1} - 2\psi_i + \psi_{i+1}}{(\Delta x)^2}  \tag{4}
$$

where $(\Delta x)$ is the distance between discrete points $x_i$. We will choose dimensionless units for each problem, where $x$ is measured in terms of a length $a$, and $E$ is therefore measured in units of $\frac{\hbar^2}{2m a^2}$.  We can therefore write the kinetic energy term of the Hamiltonian as a "tri-diagonal" matrix $D$, which has the leading diagonal,

$$
D_{i,i} = \frac{2}{(\Delta x)^2}  \tag{5}
$$

and the diagonals above and below this are,

$$
D_{i,i+1} = D_{i,i-1} = \frac{-1}{(\Delta x)^2}   \tag{6}
$$

If we choose to measure $x$ in units of $\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{m \omega}}$, then $E$ will be measured in units of $\frac{1}{2}\hbar \omega$, and the potential can be written,

$$
V_i(x_i) = i^2 (\Delta x)^2 = x_i^2   \tag{8}
$$

The potential term can be represented by a matrix where the leading diagonal is the potential evaluated at the $i$-th point in space, $V_{i,i} = V(x_i)$, and all other entries are zero. 

Then using a linear algebra solver, we can solve for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $H$ to find the energy levels $E_n$ and wavefunctions $\psi$ of the quantum harmonic oscillator respectivly. For performance reasons we currently use the scipy.linalg.eigh_tridiagonal function, benefiting from its tailored functionality for diagonal and tridiagonal matrices. This is dicussed further in [Appendix Section 2.2](#Appendix_performance).

##### NOTE:
It is important to use a small $(\approx 0.1 a_o)$ step size for $\Delta x$. Additonally the x displacement (from which follows the range for the potential) must covering sufficient range that the largest desired wavefunction falls to zero at the extremities in order to ensure the numerical solutions stability as demonstrated in [Appendix Section 2.1](#Appendix_stability).


#### Energy Levels

We compare the computed eigenvalues with the expected eigenvalues.

Looking back on our table of analytical values for the energy levels, and filling in our simulated values we can see we get a good match between the two, with the error gradlly increasing as the energy level increases. This is to be expected as the wavefunctions become more complex and the numerical solutions become less stable.

To get a better idea of the error we can plot it as a function of n, the results show good agreement between simulation and anylitical results, a full exploration of the error as a function of the input parameters is given in [Appendix Section 2.1](#Appendix_stability).

#### Wavefunctions
We can also compare our numerically computed wavefucntions to their analytical counterparts to check that our simulation is working as expected.

*QHO  Analytical to simulation wavefucn and prob density comparisons*
</div>


In this visual comparison we can see that the wavefunctions are in good agreement with the analytical solutions, with the only difference being a phase factor in one of the waves. This is to be expected as the phase is not a physical observable and is therefore not unique. This phase shift does not effect the probability density, which we find to be in good agreement with the analytical solutions. This is quantified further in [Appendix Section 2.1](#Appendix_stability).

*The dotted u shape line shows the potential that we caluclated, combining the potential and the wavefunctions on this one plot allows us to see the classical limits, where the potential crosses each wavefunction. Classically the wavefucntion is not allowed to have a value other than 0 past these limits (turning points) but we can see here that it does, this is one of the dissagremments between classical and quantum theory.*

## Part 2 - The Hydrogen Atom

### Simulation

Having verified our method, we can use it to find the eigenvalues of a slightly more complex system - the Hydrogen atom. We will use same methodology as before but change the potential to that of the hydrogen atom. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors will then yeild the energy levels and wavefunctions of the hydrogen atom, which we shall again compare to analytical results.

In addition to having to cvhange the potential, we will also change to a spherical coordinate system to simplify our calculations as the hydrogen atom is spherically symmetric. In such a spherically symmetric system, the wavefunction can be written :

$$
\frac{1}{r}\Psi(r)Y_{lm}(\theta, \phi)e^{i m\phi} \tag{9}
$$

where $Y_{lm}(\theta, \phi)$ are the spherical harmonic functions and l, m are the angular momentum quantum numbers. The radial function $\Psi(r)$ satisfies the time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation, provided a suitable term is added to the potential.

Now that we are using a spherical coordinate system, we discritise a range of radius values, $r$, instead of $x$. If we use the Bohr radius $a_0$ as the unit $r$, where :

$$
a_0 = \frac{4 \pi \epsilon \hbar^2}{m_e e^2}  \tag{10}
$$

then the energy will be measured in units of :
$$
\frac{m_e e^4}{2 (4 \pi \epsilon_0)^2 \hbar^2}  \tag{11}
$$

and the potential for the hydrogen atom can be written :

$$
V(r_i) = \frac{-2}{r_i} + \frac{l(l+1)}{r_i^2} \tag{12}
$$

This potential is the sum of the classical attractive Coulomb interaction between the electron and the nucleus, and an additional term dependent on the **azimuthal quantum number** $l$. This term is related to the centrifugal potential, which arises due to the angular momentum of the electron. If we analyse how the overall potential changes with respect to $l$:

1. **$l = 0$ (s orbital)**:
   When $l = 0$, the term $l(l+1)/r^2$ vanishes, and the potential reduces to $V_{\text{hyd}} = -2/r$, which in non-atomic units corresponds to the classical coulumb potential:
   
   $$ 
   V(r) = -\frac{k \cdot e^2}{r} \tag{13SORT!!} 
   $$
   
   For those familliar with the orbital shell model, this corresponds to the s orbital, which is spherically symmetric. The potential is solely determined by the attractive Coulomb interaction between the electron and the nucleus.

<div align="center">

<img src="Images/output56.png" width=600>

*Columb potential*
</div>



2. **$l > 0$ (p, d, f orbitals, etc.)**:
   For $l > 0$, the term $l(l+1)/r^2$ becomes non-zero. This term contributes an additional repulsive component to the potential. As $l$ increases, this repulsive centrifugal potential becomes stronger. This reflects the fact that electrons in higher angular momentum states experience a stronger "centrifugal force" due to their higher orbital angular momentum.

   - For $l = 1$ (p orbitals), the term becomes $1/r^2$, providing an additional repulsive contribution to the potential.
   - For $l = 2$ (d orbitals), the term becomes $2/r^2$, which is stronger than for $l = 1$ and contributes even more repulsion.
   - This trend continues for higher $l$ values, with the repulsion becoming more significant as $l$ increases.


<div align="center">

<img src="Images/outputcc.png" width=600>

*Quantum Hydrogen potential, varying $l$, can see that when $l = 0$ the potential is the standard columb potential, but as $l$ increases, the centrifugal potential term increases*
</div>


Overall, for higher values of $l$, the potential energy becomes more repulsive at shorter distances compared to the $l = 0$ case, reflecting the increased centrifugal effect due to the higher angular momentum of the electron. This behavior is characteristic of the different shapes of orbitals associated with different values of $l$ in atomic systems.





We can now use the same method as outlined in section 1 to create the kinetic energy term matrix $D$ and add it to the potential $V$, to find the Hamiltonian matrix $H$. We agin use our linear algebra solver to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $H$, and compare the results to the expected eigenvalues and wavefunctions, this time for the Hydrogen atom.

!!!! to generate the Hamiltonian matrix for the Hydrogren atom, and find at least the first 5 eigenvalues for at least l=0. Compare these eigenvalues with the expected eigenvalues.
!!!!



#### NOTE:
We must use a range of $r$ such that the wavefunction become negligible, and a large number of $r$ points, at least 1000, to ensure the numerical solutions stability as demonstrated in [Appendix Section 2.1](#Appendix_stability).

The energy scale describes the required energy to move the electron from its bound state to infinity, a simpler way to think of it is the sum total energy of the nucleas and the electron is this much lower (hence the negative) than if they were seperated by an infinite distance

In addition to the quantized negative energy states of the hydrogen atom, there is also a continuum of unbound positive energy states.

The pattern in the given fractions seems to involve decreasing magnitudes of the fractions with a negative sign. Let's analyze:

|result|
|-----------|
|$-1 = -\frac{1}{1}$ |
|$-0.25 = -\frac{1}{4}$ |
|$-0.111 = -\frac{1}{9}$ |
|$-0.0625 = -\frac{1}{16}$ |
|$-0.04 = -\frac{1}{25}$ |



Each fraction appears to be the reciprocal of the square of an integer:

1^2 = 1
2^2 = 4
3^2 = 9
4^2 = 16
5^2 = 25

So, the pattern is:

-1/(n^2)

</div>

To convert our  dimensionless results given in terms of $\frac{m_e e^4}{2 (4 \pi \epsilon_0)^2 \hbar^2}$ we can solve for the energy levels in terms of eV, by inputting the required constants :

- $m_e$: mass of an electron $\approx 9.109 \times 10^{-31}$ kg
- $e$: elementary charge $\approx 1.602 \times 10^{-19}$ C
- $\epsilon_0$: vacuum permittivity $\approx 8.854 \times 10^{-12}$ F/m
- $\hbar$: reduced Planck constant $\approx 1.055 \times 10^{-34}$ J¬∑s

Which yeilds :
$$
\frac{(9.109 \times 10^{-31}) \times (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^4}{2 \times (4 \pi \times 8.854 \times 10^{-12})^2 \times (1.055 \times 10^{-34})^2} \approx 13.606 \, \text{eV} \tag{13}
$$

Which we know is the enrgy of the ground state of the hydrogen atom, and each energy level is a multiple of this value. We can then convert our dimensionless results to eV by multiplying by 13.606.

##### NOTES!¬¨!!

To find the values of the allowed energy eigenvalues of a quantum system we have to apply the hamiltonian opperator to the wavefunction $(\psi)$. To simplify the problem we have taken it in one dimension and in time independsnt form where the wavefuntion is just a function of $x$ $\psi(x)$


$$H \psi(x) = E \psi(x)$$


The Hamiltonian $H$ is given by 


$$H = \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + V $$


it contains two terms, the potential energy term V and the kinetic energy term D where 


$$D = \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2}{dx^2}$$


the potential term can be implemented easily as a simple function, however D requires the use of numerical methods as it contains a continuous derivative.


Given this, the hamiltonian is implemented as a matrix equation, with $\psi$ an $N$-dimensional vector, and $H$ an $(N \times N)$ matrix.
The matrix is symmetric, we can find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the matrix using readily availibly pyton routines from the scipy libraries. I chose to test two solvers, scipy.linalg.eig and scipy.linalg.eigh_tridiagonal to compare their results. At first the eig fucntion was returning some strange results but then i realised the returned values were not sorted, so after adding a quicksort function via np.sort() it returned the exact same results as the eigh_tridiagonal function.

As both function methods returned the exact same results it would be down to compute resources rather than accuracy to pick one, i did not implement a time loop to test the difference as my code is alredy substantial. Without having tested it i would pick using the eigh_tridiagonal function as it requires a much simpler hamiltonian function, less memory usage from not having to store the majority 0 valued matricies, and requires no np.sort to return the results.

Testing both methods on the QHO problem and then comparing the Eigenvalues to the analytical results showed that the solvers can provide acuurate results for the QHO up to around an E_n value of 10. I then did the same for comparing eigenvectors to the analytical results but only the first 4 terms. The results of the solvers come out exactly mathcing the analytical eigenvectors albeit with a scale mismatch that i assume is down to a unit conversion scaling.

Then made some interesting plots of the wavefunctions and probability distributions for a range of the QHO's energy eigenstates, including one which overlayed the potental with the wavefunctions to demonstrate the mismatch in classical and quantum theory in the ability of the wavefucntion to have a value outside of the classicly deifned turning points.

Moved on to the hydrogen atom where ran through the same as for the QHO. Compared the potential of the QHO to the Hydrogen atom which showed interesting differences in the two systems. Also compared the analytical hydrogen eigenvalues with the solvers which provide accurate results up till around E_n 20 this time.

The previous visuals were all based on the radial wavefunction which each have a unique energy value, but the total wavefucntion for the hydrogen atom consists of the radial wavefunction and the angular wavefunction which gives each energy level above n=1 more than one possible state, they are degenerate. Created visulisations for the hydrogen atoms l and m quantum numbers in 2 and 3D to show how the various numbers effect the probability distribution of the electron, showing the degenerate states that give rise to the s, p... orbital shells.

# Introduction

Most of us will have vague memories of physics classes in school, during which we were taught about how objects move based on the forces that are acting upon them. This branch of physics, essentially the study of how things move and why they are where they are, is known as 'Mechanics'. Issiac Newton's laws of motion are the foundation of mechanics and for this reason it is often refered to as 'Newtonian Mechanics'. Though genrally the are is now refered to as 'classical Mechanics' as it has been superseeded by a more accurate and fundamental theory of the universe and the subject of this simulation and discussion, Quantum Mechanics. 

The first sentance that usually follows any mention of quantum mechinics is to add that noone not event the people working with it daily understand it. This is not true, but does make for more exciting media coverage and is appreciated both by the media outlets and the scientists doing quantum wheelies. The theory is well understood and has been tested to an incredible degree of accuracy, furthermore many aspects of quantum mechincs are actually incredibly intuitive, easy to understand and downright beautiful. The reason for the rep as being to complicated to understand comes from certain areas of the theory where we are able to use the mathmatical formulisms to generate correct predictions about the real world however our verbal and mental explination for the physical significance of the actual mechnisms behind what is happening are still in dispute. This is not unique to quantum mechinics, a good example is gravity, we are able to use our current mathmatical forulisms for gravitation to calulate answers to a high degree of accuracy, however we do not have a complete understanding of the physical significance of the mechnisms behind it, Einstien brought our understanding to a new level with his theory of general relativity showing the effetc of gravity are due to a curvature of space-time rather than a force acting at a distance, yet we are still unable to provide a explination of the pysical mechainisms give rise to the curvature, or even what it actully means for space-time to curve. It is a fair point to raise to say that our current thedry of gravity is already known to be incomplete as it is a classical theory of gravity and we are yet to be able to incorperate gravity into our current quantum frameworks (this persuit is often known as the search for the theory of everything, as quantum field theory doosent currently describes every single fundemental particle and fundemental foce of nature other than gravity) however the point still stands that we are able to use the mathmatical forulisms to make correct predictions about the world, whilst not being able to explain the physical mechanism in a way that is intuitive to us and we do not hear people denouncing gravity as beyond our conception everytime it is mentioned.

This simulation and write up aims to provide a way to bring together many seemingly disparate concepts in quantum mechanics to provide a more intuitive understanding of the subject. We also approch the topic from the concept of 'quantisation' and 'potential energy' that will feel very familliar to anyone who has walked up a hill or set of stairs before. 


## Quantum Mechanics (Brief Overview)
but the theory is so different from our everyday experience that it is hard to understand. The theory is based on the idea that the fundemental building blocks of the universe are not particles but waves, and that these waves are not waves of anything we can imagine, they are waves of probability.

## Quantisation
One of the main ideas of quantum meachnics that sets it apart from classical mechincs and contributes to he name of the field is the idea of **quantisation**. In classical mechanics we are used to the idea that reality is continuos, meaning you may be here, there, somwherein between the tow places, you might have a speed of 5m/s or 5.5m/s or 5.55 m/s we are used to the idea that there are indfinitely more smaller divisions of everything. In quantum mechanics however, we find that certian properties of the universe are quantised, meaning they can only take on certian values, and these values are not continous, they are discrete. This is actually incredibly intuitive idea, especially to any programmers out there, who are used to having to work in discrete values even if you wish you didnt have to. 

This si quite a simple concept, on the one hand you coul dimaging a hill with a perfectly flat and sloped side being the continuous universe, wehre you can take any height position on thew hill, and then you could imagine beside it a set of steps, where you can only take on certian heights, and you can only move up or down in steps. This is the idea of quantisation, and it is a fundemental aspect of quantum mechanics. It actually greatly simplifies reality as there is no longer infginte space between any two points, and it explains the lack of diversity in the universe, as there are only certian 
values that are allowed and so we will conformity in the fundemantal building blocks across the universe compared to one with continuos properties. 


## Understanding Atoms
ytou may say okay that is simple but what was the need for us to switch to this when we already had a perfectly nice continuos world view, cant we just stick to that. The answer is that the development of quantum mechnics was down to reality tellin gus that our previous ideas were wrong. One of the first indication that the universe was not as we thought came from the study of atoms. We had a pretty good idea of what they were made of, a nucleas in the centre made of protons and neutrons, and then electrons orbiting the nucleas. The problem was that the electrons were not behaving as we expected them to.


## Quantum Numbers


## Fundemental Properties
One aspect of quantum mechanics that can be foriegn to people is the idea that certian properties that we think of as being intrinsic to an object, such as its position are not fundemental at all. A way to analogise this that immidetly makes sense is to imagine you are playing a computer game, you walk into a room in the game and there is an object in the room. The people who created the game may have defined in the games code that this item is to appear in this fixed position in the room, we would say that the object has a position that is fundemental. This is how classical mechanics functions, in that in classical mechanics we assume that objects intrisicly have a fundemental position, and then we just observe what that fundentmal position is. Quantum mechanics however is quite different from this natural assumption. In quatum mechanics certian properties that we think of as being intrinsic to an object, such as position are not fundemental at all. In the example of our game, instead of the code specifying the posiiton of the object, the code specifies a probability distribution of the position of the object, meaning the code specifies a range of possible locations and a probability of the object being in each of these locations, maybe a 10% chance of being in room A and 90% in room b, then when we play the game and load into the mission the ojects position will be randomly selected based ont heprabbailities and fixed in one of these locations. In this case the reality of the object is that it does not have a **fundemental** position, rather **it** has a probability distribution of positions and then when we load the game it takes a fixed position. The underlying reality of position is statistical not the other way round. Everything so far has been pretty simple, but we cannot avoid the question, in real life when do objects go from thier probability thingy to actually being in a position? This is a shame as it is almost the first question anyone would ask and is the exact part of quatum mechanics that is currently hotly debated, we do not have a way to describe the physical significance and mechanism for this process, leading to many curious people getting bogged down right from the start. In our game analogy the object becomes fixed in a place when the game level loads, in reality qauntum objects take a fixed position when they are measured, which is known as the 'collapse' of the wavefunction. Luckily this question, whilst incredible interesting, is not neccesary to understand any of the rest of quantum mechanics and for those interested is already widely covered. We shall skirt round when and how things go from probabilities to 'localised' in this write up, and focus on the more intuitive aspects of quantum mechanics. 

You may be thinking well that is interesting but what does it matter if in the code the item is defined as a fixed position or a probability distribution, as once I'm in the game it take on a fixed position either way, and the probility code is then meaningless! This is a fair point and where my analogy falls down, as in our game example the interactions the object is a part of are calulated based on the expression of its position at that time. In reality, interactions of quantum mechanical systems and objects happen based on the fundemental properties not the macroscopic expressions, and the fundemental properties do not include position, rather the wavefunction. 






### Quantum Numbers

Quantum numbers are numbers that specify the state of a quantum system. If you know all of the quantum numbers for a system that is a complete description of state. A way to analogise this is to think of a chess board. To have a full definition of the state of the chess game i.e. all the information required to exactly recreate the game, you could write down the information of whatis present in each qaure of the board. However, this fixes the information to the spacial domain, wheras in reality properties are tied to objects not the space they inhabit. Additonally stroign information for every square (spatial position) requires more information storage as data is kept on empty squares.For an object focused definiton of state in the smallest amount of information possible, you would need to know the piece type, color (white/black) and the board position for each piece on the board. The amount of information required to define the state of the chess game is 3 values per piece present on the board, we could give these three bits of information quantum numbers a b and c for chess pieces. 

An important note here is that although i have used the position of the chess peices as one of thier quantum numbers in this analogy, this is only to get across the conncept of a full definition of state for a system. There is no quantum number tied to position, they are tied to the properties of the object, from which the positotion is emergent. Further, quantum mechanics does not allow for the exact position of a particle to be known at all, only the **probability** of finding it in a certain position, which we derive from the wavefunction.




The quantum harmonic oscillator, which describes a particle (often an electron) confined in a quadratic potential well, possesses only one quantum number, which represents the energy level of the oscillator. This is the single piece of information required to define the entire state of the oscillating system. The quantum number representing the energy of a quantum system is called the principle quantum number, and is denoted by the letter $n$. Its values are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...) meaning a quantum harmonic oscillator can have energy levels of n = 1, n = 2, n = 3 etc.

In the case of an electron in an atom the quantum numbers are more complex, as the electron is confined in a 3D potential well. The quantum numbers for an electron in an atom are the principal quantum number (n), the azimuthal quantum number (l), the magnetic quantum number (m), and the spin quantum number (s). The principal quantum number (n) is the same as for the quantum harmonic oscillator, and represents the energy level of the electron. The azimuthal quantum number (l) represents the angular momentum of the electron, and the magnetic quantum number (m) represents the projection of the angular momentum along a given axis. The spin quantum number (s) represents the intrinsic angular momentum of the electron, either spin up or spin down.
